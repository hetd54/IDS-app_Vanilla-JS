      <h1>BROWN UNIVERISITY</h1>
      <h2>CONSENT FOR RESEARCH PARTICIPATION</h2>
      <p>
        You and your child are invited to take part in a Brown University
        research study. Your participation is voluntary.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          RESEARCHER: Roman Feiman, PhD, Director of Brown Language and Thought
          Lab, sites.brown.edu/bltlab
        </li>
        <li>
          PURPOSE: The study is about what children understand about language.
          We are interested in the types of information children use when they
          interpret sentences.
        </li>
        <li>
          PROCEDURES: Your child will be presented with a set (2-4) of options
          on your computer screen, usually among different kinds of toys. He/She
          will be asked to choose between the options based upon criteria set by
          the researcher (usually which choice has more, or a higher reward).
          During the session, you and your child will be recorded via your
          computer's webcam and microphone. Video recordings and other data you
          enter are sent securely to our lab. Your child may also be presented
          with English sentences one at a time and will be asked to judge
          whether the sentence is right or appropriate for a given situation.
          You or your child may also be asked to fill out a questionnaire
          related to your childâ€™s vocabulary or language(s). The goal is to
          characterize the process of language development, not to characterize
          individual children.
        </li>
        <li>
          TIME INVOLVED: The study will take approximately 30-45 minutes of your
          time.
        </li>
        <li>
          COMPENSATION: You will receive $5 for compensation of your time. You
          will be asked to provide your email to researchers in order to receive
          an electronic gift certificate. You will receive your gift within a
          week of participating. This email will only be used to send your gift
          unless you opt-in to future communication with Brown developmental
          labs.
        </li>
        <li>
          RISKS: We have attempted to minimize the risk of yours and your
          child's identifiable information being accessed. All information
          pertaining to the studies (screening forms, behavioral, and video
          data) will be identified with a unique arbitrary number. In reports,
          you and your child will not be identified individually. Your child may
          or may become tired of answering questions. You or your child may
          choose to stop the procedures at any time.
        </li>
        <li>
          BENEFITS: You and your child may not directly benefit from being in
          this research study.
        </li>
        <li>
          CONFIDENTIALITY: All subjects will be coded and assigned a number to
          be used for data files. One lab computerized password protected file
          will link that number with subject identifying and demographic
          information. If information regarding child abuse or neglect is
          disclosed or witnessed, it must be reported to appropriate agencies.
          Brown University staff sometimes review studies like this one to make
          sure they are being done safely and correctly. If a review of this
          study takes place, your records may be examined. The reviewers will
          protect your confidentiality.
        </li>
        <li>
          VOLUNTARY: You and your child do not have to be in this study if you
          do not want to be. Even if you decide to be in this study, you and/or
          your child can change your mind and stop at any time.
        </li>
        <li>

          participation in this study, you can call Roman Feiman at (401)
